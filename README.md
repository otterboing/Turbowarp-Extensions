A collection of all my Turbowarp extensions! <a href="https://otterboing.neocities.org/extensions" target="_blank"><img width="32" title="yippee" src="Extra%20Files/guy2.png" /></a>

It's a bit small right now but the stash will grow bigger!

## Sandboxed Extensions

Extensions run with the Sandbox enabled will be much slower or may not work at all!

<sub>Additionally any buttons probably won't work.</sub>

#### Un-sandboxed extensions:

- [Cursors-Extended ![](Extra%20Files/UnSandboxed!.png)](Extensions/Cursors-Extended.js) - Requires JS to change the Scratch Canvas's CSS.
- [Inline Variables ![](Extra%20Files/UnSandboxed!.png)](Extensions/InlineVariables.js) - Requires JS to manage the variables.
- [HTML ![](Extra%20Files/UnSandboxed!.png)](Extensions/HTML.js) - Requires JS to manage and edit the DOM.
- [Marked In Turbowarp ![](Extra%20Files/UnSandboxed!.png)](Extensions/markedInTurbowarp.js) - Requires JS to add and use [marked.js](https://marked.js.org).
